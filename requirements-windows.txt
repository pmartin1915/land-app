# Alabama Auction Watcher - Windows-Specific Requirements
# Optional packages for enhanced Windows desktop integration
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
#
# These packages enable:
# - Advanced desktop shortcut creation with proper Windows .lnk files
# - Start Menu integration
# - System registry integration
# - Auto-startup configuration
# - Enhanced system tray functionality (if available)

# Core Windows desktop integration (required for advanced installer)
pywin32>=311
winshell>=0.6

# Optional: Enhanced system tray support
# Uncomment these lines for system tray functionality:
# pystray>=0.19.4
# pillow>=9.0.0

# Optional: Better Windows terminal integration
# Uncomment these lines for enhanced terminal support:
# colorama>=0.4.6
# windows-curses>=2.3.1

# Note: These packages are Windows-only and will fail on other platforms.
# For cross-platform compatibility, use the main requirements.txt file only.
#
# The Alabama Auction Watcher will work without these packages using the
# simple shortcut creator, but the advanced features require these dependencies.
